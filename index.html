    <span>How I Got Into Coding</span><br>My name is Margaret Godowns and I'm a front-end student at The Iron Yard in Charleston. I'm from Orangeburg, SC. I was an English major and philosophy minor in college and thought I wanted to work for a magazine. After I graduated in 2013, I did work for a magazine, and decided it wasn't for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I read about a free, 10-day coding bootcamp that was being run by the online coding school Skillcrush, whose mission is to attract more post-grad girls to development. I took it and loved it, though now it's really funny that they call it a 'bootcamp' when it should really be called a cakewalk.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I was hooked, so I looked around at grad-school programs and quickly found The Iron Yard. After looking at the website, I waited one day, applied, interviewed, got in, and joyously quit my job. Now I'm just typing things because I'm trying to fill this space so it will look aesthetically pleasing and the pictures will sidle up alongside each other.
